# BUILDING-A-PERSONALIZED-LEARNING-PATH-FOR-STUDENTS-USING-ML
This project demonstrates how to use machine learning techniques to design a personalized learning path for students. Traditional education often uses a one-size-fits-all approach, which doesn‚Äôt cater to each student‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses. This system aims to optimize learning by analyzing individual behaviors, performance, and preferences to create tailored recommendations that enhance engagement and academic results.

Key ML algorithms implemented include:

1.K-Means Clustering: Groups students with similar learning behaviors and styles.

2.Decision Trees & Random Forests: Classify students‚Äô strengths and predict areas that need improvement.

3.Collaborative Filtering: Recommends relevant study materials and assignments.

4.Reinforcement Learning: Continuously adapts learning paths based on student progress and feedback.

5.Natural Language Processing (NLP): Analyzes student feedback and text-based interactions to refine suggestions.

The system architecture integrates data collection from learning management systems (LMS), preprocessing with Pandas and Scikit-learn, model training and prediction, and a recommendation engine that dynamically updates based on real-time student performance.

‚úÖ Features

1.Identifies student learning patterns automatically

2.Suggests custom study materials and assignments

3.Tracks progress and adapts recommendations

4.Analyzes student feedback using NLP

5.Designed for scalability and integration with LMS platforms

üöÄ How to Use

1.Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Ashwinvimal/personalized-learning-path.git
cd personalized-learning-path

2.Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed

3.Install required libraries:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Run the Model

Launch the script that collects user interests and predicts a learning path:

python learning_path_predictor.py

4.Provide Input

Answer the prompt questions (e.g., ‚ÄúDo you enjoy Science?‚Äù) with 1 for Yes and 0 for No.

5.Get Your Recommendation

The system will output a recommended learning path based on your inputs.
